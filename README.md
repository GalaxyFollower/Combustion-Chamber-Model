# Combustion-Chamber-Model
This is a MATLAB model of a combustion chamber for a LOX-methane rocket. For various initial droplet diameters, the simulation calculates droplet diameter, gas temperature, equivalence ratio, gas and droplet velocities, and vapor flow rates as a function of position along the axis of the combustion chamber. More specifications about the problem are given in a PDF file in this repository. This was a project in Ae121b (Space Propulsion), taken in my senior year at Caltech.
